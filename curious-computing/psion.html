### ![ARM](http://www.arm.com/images/site/arm_logo.gif)710T
With MMU, Clocked at 18Mhz (32Mhz on the 5MX).

### Stories and Significance
EG: One of very few ARM devices to have an 'ARM Powered' logo on the bottom of it.
This thing would run for two weeks with just AA batteries, and had a 640px wide display.

The keyboard is really, really good - I could type at 60 wpm when I was used to it.

### Software
EG: EPOC32, which became Symbian OS. The OS came bundled with a Word, Excel and Access equivalent, as well as a BASIC (OPL, actully) interpreter.

It is also possible to install Linux on the Psion 5, but you realise how well designed EPOC32 is when you do that...
